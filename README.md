# tkunitconverter
a basic unit converter made with tkinter

I dont suspect this to be useful to anybody since there are better/more convenient converters

but it was fun to make

# how to use

there is a measurment dropdown list, choose which measurment to convert from there

measurments are LENGTH, WIDTH, and TEMPERATURE

from them you can choose which system to take, and which system to convert to

and from those you can choose which unit you want to go from, and convert to

press swap to swap the input text box and the output label

press convert to convert the input

the options frame contains the options, although there is only one option...
